To insert data into the database through the main webpage (index.html), each button when clicked takes you to the corresponding form to fill out, this will then call a PHP file that makes a connection to SQL and inserts those values to the database. Also, to show the database currently on the database the 'Show' button triggers a PHP file that makes a connection to the corresponding database using SQL and show the data from the database.
